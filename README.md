# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple Python-based console game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number within a specific range. The game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Key Features

- **Random Number Generation:** The game generates a random number within a range specified by the developer.
- **User Input:** The player inputs their guesses to find the correct number.
- **Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Guess Counter:** Tracks how many attempts the player takes to guess the correct number.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Launch the Python program in the terminal.
2. **Guess a Number:** The game will prompt you to guess a number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
3. **Receive Feedback:** If your guess is too high or too low, the game will notify you.
4. **Win the Game:** Keep guessing until you correctly identify the random number.

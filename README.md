# Blackjack Game

## Overview

This project is a simplified version of the classic **Blackjack** game, also known as 21. The game is played between a **player** and the **dealer** (the computer), with the objective being to have cards with a total value closer to 21 than the dealer's cards, without exceeding 21. The game uses a standard deck of cards, with an Ace counting as either 1 or 11 based on the player's choice.

## Rules of the Game

1. The player is dealt two cards initially.
2. The dealer is also dealt two cards, but only one of the dealer's cards is visible to the player.
3. The player can choose to **Hit** (draw another card) or **Stand** (end their turn).
4. The goal is to get the card total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
5. Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
6. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
7. Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on the player's decision.
8. The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher.

### Win Conditions

- **Player wins** if their total is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21.
- **Dealer wins** if the dealer's total is closer to 21 or if the player goes over 21 (busts).
- **Draw** if both the player and dealer have the same score.

## How to Play

1. The player is asked to choose how they want to count an Ace (1 or 11).
2. The dealer's first card is visible while the second one remains hidden until the player decides to **Stand**.
3. The player can **Hit** to draw another card or **Stand** to stop drawing and let the dealer play.
4. After the player stands, the dealer will reveal their hidden card and draw cards until their score is at least 17.
5. The game compares the final scores to determine the winner.

## Features

- **Randomized Card Dealing**: The cards are shuffled and dealt randomly from a virtual deck.
- **Ace Handling**: Aces can be counted as 1 or 11, based on the player's decision.
- **Automatic Dealer Logic**: The dealer draws cards automatically until the total score is at least 17.
- **Dynamic Win Conditions**: The game checks after each round to see if the player or dealer has won or busted.

## Code Breakdown

### `initial_player_cards()`
This function deals two initial cards to the player and calculates their score based on the card values.

### `initial_computer_cards()`
This function deals two initial cards to the dealer, but only one is visible to the player. The score of the visible card is displayed.

### `update_player_score(card)`

### `hit_computer_cards()`
Allows the dealer to draw cards and updates the score until the dealer reaches at least 17 points.
